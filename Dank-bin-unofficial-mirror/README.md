**__But Dounial; how do I set up the package from start if I'm new to Linux?__**
It's simple! Just go to this' GitHub repositories folder and on the right upper side below the pinning and watching-areas select code, you want to copy the HTTPS-link as seen here:<br>
![Picture to showcase code share-function](href=https://i.imgur.com/DcLQkFW.png) <br> 
home directory, open a terminal-window and type "sudo git clone *" where * is the link you just copied from before.<br>
Now you just need to open the directory you just created with "cd Dank-bin-unofficial-mirror" and type "makepkg".<br>
Then you can run the created "dank"-file with "./dank" or "sudo bash dank".<br>

Enjoy! ãƒ„
